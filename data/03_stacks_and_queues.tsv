3	1	Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.	Three in One
3	2	How would you design a stack which, in addition to *push* and *pop*, has a function *min* which returns the minimum element?  *Push*, *pop*, and *min* should all operate in O(1) time.	Stack Min
3	3	Imagine a (literal) stack of plates.  If the stack gets too high, it might topple.  Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold.  Implement a data structure, SetOfStacks that mimics this.  SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.  SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).	Stack of Plates
3	4	Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.	Queue via Stacks
3	5	"Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top.  
You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array).
The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty."	Sort Stack
3	6	"An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly ""first in, first out"" basis.  People must adopt either the ""oldest"" (based on arrival time) of all animals in the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type).  They cannot select which specific animal they would like.  Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement options such as enqueue, dequeAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat.  You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure."	Animal Shelter
