6	4	Ther are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of a collision (between any or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed. Similarly, find the probability of collision with "n" ants on an "n"-vertex polygon.	Ants on a Triangle
