16	10	"Given a list of people with their birth and death years, implement a method to compute the year with the most number of people alive. You may assume that all people were born between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive). If a person was alive during any portion of that year, they should be included in that year's count. For example, Person (birth = 1908, death = 1909) is included in the counts for both 1908 and 1909."	"Living People"
16	11	"You are building a diving board by placing a bunch of plants of wood end-to-end. There are two types of planks, one of length `shorter` and one of length `longer`. You must use exactly `K` plants of wood. Write a method to generate all possible lengths for the diving board"	"Diving Board"
16	12	"Since XML is very verbose, you are given a way of encoding it where each tag gets mapped to a pre-defined integer value. The language/grammar is as follows:

Element   --> Tag Attributes END Children END
Attribute --> Tag value
END       --> 0
Tag       --> some predefined mapping to int
Value     --> string value

For example, the following XML might be converted into the compressed string below (assuming a mapping of family -> 1, person -> 2, firstName -> 3, lastName -> 4, state -> 5).
<family lastName='McDowell' state='CA'>
    <person firstName='Gayle'>Some Message</person>
</family>
Becomes:
1 4 McDowell 5 CA 0 2 3 Gayle - Some Message 0 0
Write code to print the encoded version of an XML element (passed in `Element` and `Attribute` objects).

16	13	"Given two squares on a two-dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two squares in half. Assume that the top and the bottom sides of the square run parallel to the x-axis"	"Bisect Squares"
16	14	"Given a two-dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most number of points."	"Best Line"
16	15	"The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:
The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red (R), yellow (Y), and green (G) or blue (B). For example, the computer might have RGGB (Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue).
You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess YRGB.
When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a 'hit'. If you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a 'pseudo-hit'. Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a pseudo-hit.
For example, if the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you one hit and one pseudo-hit.
Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and pseudo-hits.

16	16	"Given an array of integers, write a method to find indices `m` and `n` such that if you sorted elements `m` through `n`, the entire array would be sorted. Minimize `n` - `m` (that is, find the smallest such sequence).

EXAMPLE
    Input: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19
    Output: (3, 9)
"	"Sub Sort"
16	17	"You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the contiguous sequence with the largest sum. Return the sum.

EXAMPLE
    Input: 2, -8, 3, -2, 4, -10
    Output: 5 (i.e., { 3, -2, 4})
"	"Contiguous Sequence"
16	18	"You are given two strings, `pattern` and `value`. The `pattern` string consists of just the letters a and b, describing a pattern within a string. For example, the string `catcatgocatgo` matches the pattern `aabab` (where `cat` is `a` and `go` is `b`). It also matches pattern like `a`, `ab`, and `b`. Write a method to determine if `value` matches `pattern`."	"Pattern Matching"
16	19	"You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the value at that location represents the height above sea level. A value of zero indicates water. A pond is a region of water connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The size of the pond is the total number of connected water cells. Write a method to compute the sizes of all ponds in the matrix.

EXAMPLE
    Input:
       0 2 1 0
       0 1 0 1
       1 1 0 1
       0 1 0 1
    Output: 2, 4, 1 (in any order)

16	20	"On old cell phones, users typed on a numeric keypad and the phone would provide a list of words that matched these numbers. Each digit mapped to a set or 0 - 4 letters. Implement an algorithm to return a list of matching words, given a sequence of digits. You are provided a list of valid words (provided in whatever data structure you'd like). TODO: How to show the matching?

    Input: 8733
    Output: tree, used

16	21	"Given two arrays of integers, fin da pair of values (one value from each array) that you can swap to give the two arrays the same sum.

    Output: {1, 3}

16	22	"An ant is sitting on an infinite grid of white and black squares. Initially, the grid is all white and the ant faces right. At each step, it does the following:
1 - At a white square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees right (clockwise), and move forward one unit.
2 - At a black square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees left (counter-clockwise), and move forward one unit.

Write a program to simulate the first `K` moves that the ant makes and print the final board as a grid. Note that you are not provided with the data structure to represent the grid. This is something you must design yourself. The only input to your method is `K`. You should print the final grid and return nothing. The method signature might be something like `void printKMoves(int K)`."	"Langton's Ant"
16	23	"Implement a method `rand7()` given `rand5()`. That is, given a method that generates a random integer between 0 and 4 (inclusive), write a method that generates a random integer between 0 and 6 (inclusive)."	"Rand7 from Rand5"
16	24	Design an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array which sum to a specified value."	"Pairs with Sum"
16	25	"Design and build a least recently used' cache, which evicts the least recently used item. The cache should map from keys to values (allowing you to insert and retrieve a value associated with a particular key) and be initialized with a max size. When it is full, it should evict the least recently used item."	"LRU Cache"
16	26	"Given an arithmetic equation consisting of positive integers, +, -, * and / (no parentheses), compute the result.
