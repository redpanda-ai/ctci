15	1	"What's the difference between a thread and a process?"	"Thread vs. Process"
15	2	"How would you measure the time spent in a context switch?"	"Context Switch"
15	3	"In the famous dining philosophers problem, a bunch of philosophers are sitting around a circular table with one chopstick between each of them. A philosopher needs both chopsticks to eat, and always picks up the left chopstick before the right one. A deadlock could potentially occur if all the philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time. Using threads and locks, implement a simulation of the dining philosophers problem that prevents deadlocks."	"Dining Philosophers"
15	4	"Design a class which provides a lock only if there are no possible deadlocks."	"Deadlock-Free Class"
15	5	"Suppose we have the following code:
public class Foo {
    public Foo() { ... }
    public void first() { ... }
    public void second() { ... }
    public void third() { ... }
}
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. ThreadA will call first, threadB will call second, and threadC will call third. Design a mechanism to ensure that first is called before second and second is called before third."	"Call In Order"
15	6	"You are given a class with synchronized method A and normal method B. If you have two threads in one instance of a program, can they both execute A at the same time? Can they execute A and B at the same time?"	"Synchronized Methods"
15	7	"In the classic problem FizzBuzz, you are told to print the numbers from 1 to n. However, when the number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'. When it is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'. When it is divisible by 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'. In this problem, you are asked to do this in a multithreaded way. Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads. One thread checks for divisibility of 3 and prints 'Fizz'. Another thread is responsible for divisibility by 5 and prints 'Buzz'. A third thread is responsible for divisibility by 3 and 5 and prints 'FizzBuzz'. A fourth thread does the numbers."	"FizzBuzz"
