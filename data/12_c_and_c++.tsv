Major	Minor	Question	Title
12	1	"Write a method to print the last K lines of an input file using C++"	"Last K Lines"
12	2	"Implement a function   void reverse(char* str) in C or C++ which reverses a null-terminated string."	"Reverse String"
12	3	"Compare and constrast a hash table and an STL map. How is a hash table implemented? If the number of inputs is small, which data structure options can be used instead of a hash table?"	"Hash Table vs. STL Map"
12	4	"How do virtual functions work in C++?"	"Virtual Functions"
12	5	"What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy? Explain how you would use each."	"Shallow vs. Deep Copy"
12	6	"What is the significance of the keyword ""volatile"" in C?"	"Volatile"
12	7	"Why does a destructor in base class need to be declared virtual?"	"Virtual Base Class"
12	8	"Write a method that takes a pointer to a ""Node"" structure as a parameter and returns a complete copy of the passed in data structure. The ""Node"" data structure contains two pointers to other ""Nodes""."	"Copy Node"
12	9	"Write a smart pointer class. A smart pointer is a data type, usually implemented with templates, that simulates a pointer while also providing automatic garbage collection. It automatically counts the number of references to a ""SmartPointer<T*>"" object and fress the object of type ""T"" when the reference count hits zero."	"Smart Pointer"
12	10	"Write an aligned 'malloc' and 'free' function that supports allocating memory such that the memory addressed returned is divisible by a specific power of two.
EXAMPLE:
  'aligned_malloc(1000, 128)' will return a memory address that is a multiple of 128 and that points to a memory of size 1000 bytes.
  'aligned_free()' will free memory allocated by 'aligned_malloc'."	"Malloc"
12	11	"Write a function in C called ""my2DAlloc"" which allocates a two-dimensional array. Minimize the number of calls to ""malloc"" and make sure that the memory is accessible by the notation ""arr[i][j]"".
