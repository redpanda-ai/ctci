17	1	"Write a function that adds two numbers. You should use + or any arithmetic operators."	"Add Without Plus"
17	2	"Write a method to shuffle a deck of cards. It must be a perfect shuffle - in other words, each of the 52! permutations of the deck has to be equally likely. Assume that you are given a random number generator which is perfect."	"Shuffle"
17	3	"Write a method to randomly generate a set of `m` integers from an array of size `n`. Each element must have equal probability of being chosen."	"Random Set"
17	4	"An array `A` contains all the integers from 0 to `n`, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in `A` with a single operation. The elements of `A` are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is 'fetch the jth bit of A[i]', which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?"	"Missing number"
17	5	"Given an array filled with letters and numbers, find the longest subarray with an equal number of letters and numbers"	"Letters and Numbers"
17	6	"Write a method to count the number of 2s that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive).

EXAMPLE
    Input: 25
    Output: 9 (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Note that 22 counts for two 2s.)

17	7	"Each year, the government releases a list of the 10000 most common baby names and their frequencies (the number of babies with that name). The only problem with this is that some names have multiple spellings. For example, 'John' and 'Jon' are essentially the same name but would be listed separately in the list. Given two lists, one of names/frequencies and the other of pairs of equivalent names, write an algorithm to print a new list of the true frequency of each name. Note that if John and Jon are synonyms, and Jon and Johnny are synonyms, then John and Johnny are synonyms. (It is both transitive and symmetric). In the final list, any name can be used as the 'real' name.

EXAMPLE
    Input:
        Names: John (15), Jon (12), Chris (13), Kris (4), Christopher (19)
        Synonyms: (Jon, John),, (John, Johnny), (Chris, Kris), (Chris, Christopher)
    Output: John (27), Kris (36)

17	8	"A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one another's shoulders. For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest possible number of people in such a tower.
EXAMPLE
    Input (ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110)
    Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom:
        (56, 90) (60, 95) (65, 100) (68, 110) (70, 150) (75, 190)

17	9	"Design an algorithm to find the kth number such that the only prime factors are 3, 5, and 7. Note that 3, 5, and 7 do not have to be factors, but it should not have any other prime factors. For example, the first several multiples would be (in order) 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 21."	"Kth Multiple"
17	10	"A majority element is an element that makes up more than half of the items in an array. Given a positive integers array, find the majority element. If there is no majority element, return -1. Do this in O(N) time and O(1) space.
EXAMPLE
    Input: 1 2 5 9 5 9 5 5 5
    Output: 5

17	11	"You have a large text file contains words. Given any two words, find the shortest distance (in terms of number of words) between them in the file. If the operation will be repeated many times for the same file (but different pairs of words), can you optimize your solution?"	"Word Distance"
17	12	"Consider a simple data structure called `BiNode`, which has pointers to two other nodes.
public class BiNode {
    public BiNode node1, node2;
    public int data;
}
The data structure `BiNode` could be used to represent both a binary tree (where node1 is the left node and node2 is the right node) or a doubly linked list (where node1 is the previous node and node2 is the next node). Implement a method to convert a binary search tree (implemented with BiNode) into a doubly linked list. The values should be kept in order and the operation should be performed in place (that is, on the original data structure)."	"BiNode"
17	13	"Oh no! You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in a lengthy document. A sentence like 'I reset the computer. It still didnt boot!' became iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot'. 
You'll deal with the punctuation and capitalization later; right now you need to re-insert he spaces. Most of the words are in a dictionary but a few are not. Given a dictionary (a list of strings), and the document (a string), design an algorithm to unconcatenate the document in a way that minimizes the number of unrecognized characters.
EXAMPLE
    Input: jesslookedjustliketimherbrother
    Output: jess looked just like tim her brother (7 unrecognized characters)

17	16	"A popular masseuse receives a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests and is debating which ones to accept. She needs a 15-minute break between appointments and therefore she cannot accept any adjacent requests. Given a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests (all multiples of 15 minutes, none overlap, and none can be moved), find the optimal (highest total booked minutes) set the masseuse can honor. Return the number of minutes.
EXAMPLE
    Input: {30, 15, 60, 75, 45, 15, 15, 45}
    Output: 180 minutes ({30, 60, 45, 45}).

17	18	"You are given two arrays, one shorter (with all distinct elements) and one longer. Find the shortest subarray in the longer array that contains all the elements in the shorter array. The items can appear in any order.
EXAMPLE
    Input: {1, 5, 9} | {7, 5, 9, 0, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 1, 5, 8, 8, 9, 7}

17	25	"Given a list of millions of words, design an algorithm to create the largest possible rectangle of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms a word (reading top to bottom). The words need not be chosen consecutively from the list, but all rows must be the same length and all columns must be the same height"	"Word Rectangle"
17	26	"The similarity of two documents (each with distinct words) is defined to be the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union. For example, if the documents consist of integers, the similarity of {1, 5, 3} and {1, 7, 2, 3} is 0.4, because the intersection has size 2 and the union has size 5.
We have a long list of documents (with distinct values and each with an associated ID) where the similarity is believed to be 'sparse'. That is, any two arbitrarily selected documents are very likely to have similarity 0. Design an algorithm that returns a list of pairs of document IDs and the associated similarity.
Print only the pairs with similarity greater than 0. Empty documents should not be printed at all. For simplicity, you may assume each document is represented as an array of distinct integers.
EXAMPLE
Input:
    13: {14, 15, 100, 9, 3}
    16: {32, 1, 9, 3, 5}
    19: {15, 29, 2, 6, 8, 7}
